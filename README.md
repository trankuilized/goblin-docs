# goblin-docs
A gitbookesque plugin set for wordpress. 


The Goblin Docs plugin is a simple WordPress plugin that allows users to create and manage documentation content and external links through custom post types. It provides an AJAX-powered frontend interface that loads documentation content dynamically when a user clicks on an item in the menu. The plugin also supports categorizing documentation content using a custom taxonomy called Goblin Docs Categories. Additionally, it offers an admin settings page to manage custom CSS for styling the documentation.
